# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification outlines the systematic cleanup and optimization of the Honda Permata Next.js project based on the comprehensive audit findings. The cleanup will be performed in phases to ensure zero disruption to existing functionality while significantly improving bundle size, maintainability, and production readiness.

The project is a sales personal website for Honda Permata that must maintain all current visual layouts, functionality, and user experience while removing unused code and optimizing dependencies.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Safe File Cleanup

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to remove unused files and duplicates so that the codebase is cleaner and more maintainable without breaking existing functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN duplicate files are identified THEN the system SHALL remove the duplicate while preserving the primary file location
2. WHEN unused UI components are identified THEN the system SHALL verify no imports exist before removal
3. WHEN removing files THEN the system SHALL maintain all existing visual layouts and functionality
4. WHEN cleanup is complete THEN all existing pages SHALL render identically to before cleanup
5. IF any file removal causes build errors THEN the system SHALL restore the file and document the dependency

### Requirement 2: Dependency Optimization

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to remove unused dependencies and pin version numbers so that the project has a smaller bundle size and more predictable builds.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN unused dependencies are identified THEN the system SHALL verify they are not used in any file before removal
2. WHEN removing dependencies THEN the system SHALL test that all existing functionality continues to work
3. WHEN "latest" versions are found THEN the system SHALL pin them to specific stable versions
4. WHEN dependency changes are made THEN the system SHALL run build and dev commands to verify functionality
5. IF dependency removal breaks functionality THEN the system SHALL restore the dependency and document the usage

### Requirement 3: Code Quality Improvements

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper linting and TypeScript configuration so that the code quality is consistent and production-ready.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN ESLint configuration is updated THEN the system SHALL fix existing linting issues without changing functionality
2. WHEN TypeScript configuration is optimized THEN the system SHALL ensure all existing code continues to compile
3. WHEN build configuration is updated THEN the system SHALL remove development-only ignores while maintaining functionality
4. WHEN linting rules are applied THEN the system SHALL preserve all existing component behavior
5. IF configuration changes break builds THEN the system SHALL revert and document the issue

### Requirement 4: Import and Export Cleanup

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to clean up unused imports and exports so that the bundle size is optimized and the code is cleaner.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN unused imports are identified THEN the system SHALL remove them without affecting functionality
2. WHEN unused exports are found THEN the system SHALL verify they are not used elsewhere before removal
3. WHEN import paths are updated THEN the system SHALL ensure all references are correctly updated
4. WHEN cleanup is complete THEN all existing components SHALL continue to work as before
5. IF import changes break functionality THEN the system SHALL restore the imports and document the usage

### Requirement 5: Asset Optimization

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to identify and remove unused assets so that the project size is optimized while maintaining all visual elements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN unused assets are identified THEN the system SHALL verify they are not referenced in any file
2. WHEN placeholder assets are evaluated THEN the system SHALL preserve those used as fallbacks
3. WHEN assets are removed THEN the system SHALL ensure no broken images or missing resources occur
4. WHEN optimization is complete THEN all existing visual layouts SHALL remain unchanged
5. IF asset removal causes visual issues THEN the system SHALL restore the asset and document the usage

### Requirement 6: Build and Performance Verification

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to verify that all optimizations maintain functionality and improve performance so that the production deployment is successful.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN cleanup phases are completed THEN the system SHALL run successful builds in both development and production modes
2. WHEN optimizations are applied THEN the system SHALL verify bundle size reduction without functionality loss
3. WHEN all changes are complete THEN the system SHALL ensure all existing routes and pages work correctly
4. WHEN testing is performed THEN the system SHALL verify all interactive elements function as before
5. IF any functionality is broken THEN the system SHALL provide rollback instructions and fix the issues

### Requirement 7: Documentation and Rollback Safety

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive documentation and rollback capability so that any issues can be quickly resolved and future maintenance is easier.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN files are removed THEN the system SHALL document what was removed and why
2. WHEN dependencies are changed THEN the system SHALL maintain a record of original versions
3. WHEN configurations are updated THEN the system SHALL backup original configurations
4. WHEN cleanup is complete THEN the system SHALL provide a summary of all changes made
5. IF rollback is needed THEN the system SHALL provide clear instructions to restore previous state
